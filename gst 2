Nice, V11 — this sounds like a solid next step after your asset management system. Let's organize this smartly from a backend route architecture perspective. The goal here is clear separation of concerns and meaningful naming that’s intuitive and scalable.

Breakdown of Features You Mentioned

1. Unmapped GST Data — fields like Miro/Migo missing for some client entries.


2. Manual Mapping UI — user sees their unmapped GSTs and maps them.


3. Client-specific data — only logged-in client can map their data.


4. Tabular View for Miro & Migo GSTs — complete view of all GSTs.

Suggested Route Naming Convention (RESTful + Semantic)

Base path: /gst


---

1. View Unmapped GST Entries

GET /gst/unmapped
Description: Fetches all unmapped GST entries for the logged-in client.

POST /gst/map
Description: Accepts mapping data submitted by client for their unmapped entries.



---

2. Get Full Miro/Migo GST Tables

GET /gst/miro
Description: Returns all Miro GSTs (tabular).

GET /gst/migo
Description: Returns all Migo GSTs (tabular).

Optional:
If you want to filter by client or date:
/gst/miro?clientId=xxx&from=yyy&to=zzz



---

3. Admin or Utility Routes (Optional)

If there’s a superadmin user, or you're planning scheduled syncs or cleanup:

GET /gst/sync-status
Description: Shows how many entries are unmapped, last sync, etc.

POST /gst/refresh
Description: Triggers data fetch/update (if data is from external ERP, etc.)



---

4. Client Routes (Optional)

If you want separate paths for client context:

GET /client/:clientId/gst/unmapped

POST /client/:clientId/gst/map


But this is optional if you're using session/user-token-based filtering on the backend.

Frontend EJS Pages Mapping (Optional Suggestion)

Pro Tips

Use client_id from req.user or req.session in backend so you don’t need to expose it in frontend.

Maintain a separate mapping_status flag in DB (e.g., isMapped = false/true) for clarity.

Add logs or an audit trail table for when a user maps an entry — good for future debugging/reporting.

Want me to sketch out an EJS template structure or Sequelize model for this too?
